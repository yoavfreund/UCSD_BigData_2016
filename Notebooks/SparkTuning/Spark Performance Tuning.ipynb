    "# Garbage Collection\n",
    "Garbage collection is one of the most complex part of the Java Virtual Machine and it has a large impact on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that Garbage Collection intends to solve is to free the memory space occupied by objects that are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some object-oriented languages such as **C++** the programmer has direct control of memory allocation. This means that each object type has to have a **constructor** and a **destructor**. The *constructor allocates* space for a new object (usually on the heap), and the *destructor de-allocates* the space when the object is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of memory management allows the programmer to write highly optimized code. On the other hand, it puts on her a significant burden as keeping track of which objects are needed and which are not can be very complex. Failing to deallocate memory in a timely manner can lead to *memory leaks* which are hard to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Java** (which is the native language of Spark) takes a different approach to memory management than **C++**. It does not require that the programmer write destructors. The only requirement on the programmer is that, when an object is no longer needed, there will be no way to reach that object from one of the variables in the program. For example, if a function assigns an object to a local variable, that object will have no pointer leading to it when the function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the program has, at any time, a set of pointers that point to objects on the **Heap**. Thi set of pointers is referred to as the *root set of references* in the figure below. When the heap gets too full, the *garbage collector* is invoked. The garbage collector identifies objects in the heap that cannot be reached from the root set of references. Those objects are the added to the \"free\" part of the heap and are made available for new objects.\n",

    "Memory usage in Spark largely falls under one of two categories: **execution** and **storage**. Execution memory refers to that used for computation in shuffles, joins, sorts and aggregations, while storage memory refers to that used for caching and propagating internal data across the cluster. In Spark, execution and storage share a unified region (M). When no execution memory is used, storage can acquire all the available memory and vice versa. Execution may evict storage if necessary, but only until total storage memory usage falls under a certain threshold (R). In other words, R describes a subregion within M where cached blocks are never evicted. Storage may not evict execution due to complexities in implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although there are two relevant configurations, the typical user should not need to adjust them as the default values are applicable to most workloads:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **spark.memory.fraction** expresses the size of M as a fraction of the (JVM heap space - 300MB) (default 0.75). The rest of the space (25%) is reserved for user data structures, internal metadata in Spark, and safeguarding against OOM errors in the case of sparse and unusually large records.\n",
    "* **spark.memory.storageFraction** expresses the size of R as a fraction of M (default 0.5). R is the storage space within M where cached blocks immune to being evicted by execution."
