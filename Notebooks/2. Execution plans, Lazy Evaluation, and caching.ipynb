    "### Execution Plans and the effect of Caching\n",
    "Unlike a regular python program, map/reduce commands do not always perform any computation when they are executed. Instead, they construct something called an **execution plan**. Only when a result is needed does the computation start. This approach is also called **lazy execution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit from lazy execution is in minimizing the the number of memory accesses. Consider for example the following map/reduce commands:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A=RDD.map(lambda x:x*x).filter(lambda x: x%2==0)\n",
    "A.reduce(lambda x,y:x+y) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands defines the following plan. For each number `x` in the RDD:\n",
    "1. Compute the square of `x`\n",
    "2. Filter out `x*x` whose value is odd.\n",
    "3. Sum the elements that were not filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive execution plan is to square all items in the RDD, store the results in a new RDD, then perform a filtering pass, generating a second RDD,  and finally perform the summation. Doing this will require iterating through the RDD three times, and creating 2 interim RDDs. As memory access is the bottleneck in this type of computation, the execution plan is slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better execution plan is to perform all three operations on each element of the RDD in sequence, and then move to the next element. This plan is faster because we iterate through the elements of the RDD only once, and because we don't need to save the intermediate results. We need to maintain only one variable: the partial sum, and as that is a single variable, we can use a CPU register."
