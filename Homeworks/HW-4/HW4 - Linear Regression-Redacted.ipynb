    "### Coefficient of determination\n",

    "The regression score comes under several names: \"Coefficient of determination\", $R^2$, \"R squared score\", \"percentage of variance explained\", \"correlation coefficient\". It is explained in more detail in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination).\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking the $R^2$-score measures the fraction of the variance of the regression output variable that is explained by the prediction function. The score varies between 0 and 1. A score of 1 means that the regression function perfectly predicts the value of $y$. A score of 0 means that it does not predict $y$ at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training score vs Test score\n",
    "Suppose we fit a regression function with 10 features to 10 data points. We are very likely to fit the data perfectly and get a score of 1. However, this does not mean that our model truly explains the data. It just means that the number of training examples we are using to fit the model is too small. To detect this situation, we can compute the score of the model that was fit to the **training set**, on a **test set**. If the ratio between the test score and the training score is smaller than, say, 0.1, then our regression function probably over-fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the importance of input variables\n",
    "The fact that a regression coefficient is far from zero provides some indication that it is important. However, the size of these coefficients also depends on the scaling of the variables. A much more reliable way to find out which of the input variables are important is to compare the score of the regression function we get when using all of the input variables to the score when one of the variables is eliminated. This is sometimes called \"sensitivity analysis\""
