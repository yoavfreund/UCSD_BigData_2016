    "Unigrams, bigrams, and in general n-grams are 1,2 or n words that appear consecutively in a single sentence. Consider the sentence:\n",

    "\n",
    "This sentence contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unigrams(single words): to(2 times), know(1 time), you(2 times), is(1 time), love(1 time)\n",
    "    Bigrams: \"to know\",\"know you\",\"you is\", \"is to\",\"to love\", \"love you\" (all 1 time)\n",

    "* Convert all text to lower case, remove all punctuations. (Finally, the text should contain only letters, numbers and spaces)\n",
    "* Count the occurance of each word and of each 2,3,4,5 - gram\n",
    "* List the 5 most common elements for each order (word, bigram, trigram...). For each element, list the sequence of words and the number of occurances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, you need to change all punctuations to a space and define as a word anything that is between whitespace or at the beginning or the end of a sentence, and does not consist of whitespace (strings consisiting of only white spaces should not be considered as words). The important thing here is to be simple, not to be 100% correct in terms of parsing English. Evaluation will be primarily based on identifying the 5 most frequent n-grams in correct order for all values of n. Some slack will be allowed in the values of frequency of ngrams to allow flexibility in text processing.   \n",

    "This text is short enough to process on a single core using standard python. However, you are required to solve it using RDD's for the whole process. At the very end you can use `.take(5)` to bring the results to the central node for printing."
