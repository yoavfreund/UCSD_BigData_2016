    "# Homework 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we are going to play with Twitter data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is represented as rows of of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example) strings.\n",
    "It consists of [tweets](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets), [messages](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types), and a small amount of broken data (cannot be parsed as JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework, we will only focus on tweets and ignore all other messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "# UPDATES\n",
    "\n",
    "## Announcement\n",
    "\n",
    "**We changed the test files size and the corresponding file paths.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid long waiting queue, we decided to limit the input files size for the Playground submissions. Please read the following files to get the input file paths:\n",
    "    * 1GB test: `../Data/hw2-files-1gb.txt`\n",
    "    * 5GB test: `../Data/hw2-files-5gb.txt`\n",
    "    * 20GB test: `../Data/hw2-files-20gb.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "**We updated the json parsing section of this notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python built-in json library is too slow. In our experiment, 70% of the total running time is spent on parsing tweets. Therefore we recommend using [ujson](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ujson) instead of json. It is at least 15x faster than the built-in json library according to our tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The tokenizer in this notebook contains UTF-8 characters. So the first line of your `.py` source code must be `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` to define its encoding. Learn more about this topic [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/).\n",
    "2. The input files (the tweets) contain UTF-8 characters. So you have to correctly encode your input with some function like `lambda text: text.encode('utf-8')`.\n",
    "3. `../Data/hw2-files-<param>` may contain multiple lines, one line for one input file. You can use a single textFile call to read multiple files: `sc.textFile(','.join(files))`.\n",
    "4. The input file paths in `../Data/hw2-files-<param>` contains trailing spaces (newline etc.), which may confuse HDFS if not removed. \n",
    "5. Your program will be killed if it cannot finish in 5 minutes. The running time of last 100 submissions (yours and others) can be checked at the \"View last 100 jobs\" tab. For your information, here is the running time of our solution:\n",
    "   * 1GB test:  53 seconds,\n",
    "   * 5GB test:  60 seconds,\n",
    "   * 20GB test: 114 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "A tweet consists of many data fields. [Here is an example](https://gist.github.com/arapat/03d02c9b327e6ff3f6c3c5c602eeaf8b). You can learn all about them in the Twitter API doc. We are going to briefly introduce only the data fields that will be used in this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `created_at`: Posted time of this tweet (time zone is included)\n",
    "* `id_str`: Tweet ID - we recommend using `id_str` over using `id` as Tweet IDs, becauase `id` is an integer and may bring some overflow problems.\n",
    "* `text`: Tweet content\n",
    "* `user`: A JSON object for information about the author of the tweet\n",
    "    * `id_str`: User ID\n",
    "    * `name`: User name (may contain spaces)\n",
    "    * `screen_name`: User screen name (no spaces)\n",
    "* `retweeted_status`: A JSON object for information about the retweeted tweet (i.e. this tweet is not original but retweeteed some other tweet)\n",
    "    * All data fields of a tweet except `retweeted_status`\n",
    "* `entities`: A JSON object for all entities in this tweet\n",
    "    * `hashtags`: An array for all the hashtags that are mentioned in this tweet\n",
    "    * `urls`: An array for all the URLs that are mentioned in this tweet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data source\n",
    "\n",
    "All tweets are collected using the [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Users partition\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the original tweets, we will provide you with a Pickle file, which contains a partition over 452,743 Twitter users. It contains a Python dictionary `{user_id: partition_id}`. The users are partitioned into 7 groups."
